# Tasks for internship program in Greece

## Task description : 

* Create a custom build form – the user can add or remove fields at will. (The fields to be added or deleted have to be of just 2 types – text & select)
* When the user saves the data from the form, all the data has to be displayed in a table. The table will have at the header the name of each field, for example First name, and in the first row the answers of the form submitted, for example Dimitris.

## Realization:

- I've used purely JavaScript and JQuery for buliding this client side application.
- For saving the data and displaying it in the table I used localStorage.
- In task description there was a possibilty for me to use some backend technologies, but since I thought there are gonna be probably more task incoming I built this in most convenient way, which is also user friendly.
- Since I've used localStorage data doesn't get deleted when we reload the page.
